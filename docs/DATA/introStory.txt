Welcome adventurer! It appears that you have been summoned to The Spire.
I do not envy you adventurer, but I wish you luck on your journey, it will not
be an easy one...

You see, this story starts off like so many others do. A land of peace and
prosperity thrown into lunacy and chaos. To tell you the story of the spire
first I must tell you the story of the Druids who used to live in the blasted
lands you see before you now. But our story begins in a time before the spire,
when these lands were a lush forest.

Our story starts deep in the Ancient Bloodberry forest, the Druids
Grove stood as a monolithic city where all the kingdoms would come together
as kin, in peace. The Grove had been built on an ancient mana source,
some say, and the Druids found a way to harness this mana source to create
an aura around the Grove which pacified anything in its grasp.

Spiders would not even eat bugs Adventurer! I mean they really killed it with
the peace aura, I can't stress this enough. Back to the story:

And as all things that start with good intentions go, the Druids ended up
laying down a cobblestone pathway to hell. After many centuries of the Grove
flourishing, without change, the Druids decided that all the worlds should be
at peace as they were. Where they went wrong was trying to pacify Hades.
They got this great idea that they could extend the aura from the well all
the way into the underworld! AND SOOTH THE DAMNED!!!

Adventurer. Please tell me you see where this is going, like my god right...

So they did it. The Druids called the magic users from all 5 kingdoms to come
together and channel their energy into the mana well so that they could
sooth the damned... Something, of course, went wrong. They ended up bringing
part of Hades here! Or so the story goes.

In a flash of light, able to be seen from the farthest corners of the farthest
kingdoms, the Grove was consumed by the spire. The deep purple aura that you
can see now what all the kingdoms seen so many years ago. It is believed
that the magic contained in the Grove is what gives the spire its power, that
the spire is feasting off the mana well, and using its power to lure victims
in.
    The spire is sentient...     
                            Maybe,
                                  it is.

They say that anyone who comes close enough to be touched by that aura is
consumed by a desire to enter the spire, a desire so deep, they lose themselves
    
    Eventually...
                 They always go...
                                  They have to go...
                                                    They don't come back...





Well... I guess that's probably enough of listening to some old man ramble on
about a big purple spire of death. I can see it in your eyes Adventurer, you
touched the aura, it's already got you. So, good luck young Adventurer. If you
do end up making it out, come find me will you? It would be nice for an old man
to have some closure with that blasted thing before I go.
